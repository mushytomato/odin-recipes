    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Classic Margherita Pizza is a timeless and beloved Italian dish that celebrates simplicity and exquisite
        flavors. To begin this delectable recipe, gather the following ingredients: pizza dough, ripe tomatoes, fresh
        mozzarella cheese, extra-virgin olive oil, fresh basil leaves, minced garlic, salt, and ground black pepper.</p>

    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 475°F (245°C) to ensure a perfectly crisp crust. While the oven heats up, gently
        flatten the pizza dough on a floured surface, forming a round or rectangular shape to your liking. Transfer the
        flattened dough onto a baking sheet or pizza stone lightly dusted with cornmeal to prevent sticking.</p>

    <p>Next, prepare the tomato sauce by blending ripe tomatoes until smooth, then season it with a pinch of salt, a
        dash of olive oil, and minced garlic for a subtle hint of pungency. Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the
        pizza dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</p>

    <p>Now, it's time to assemble the toppings. Slice fresh mozzarella cheese into thin rounds and place them atop the
        tomato sauce, allowing the creamy cheese to melt and ooze its rich flavor across the pizza. Sprinkle a pinch of
        salt and ground black pepper over the cheese for an extra touch of seasoning.</p>

    <p>Slide the pizza into the preheated oven and let it bake for 12 to 15 minutes or until the crust turns golden
        brown, and the cheese bubbles enticingly.</p>

    <p> Once the pizza emerges from the oven, garnish it with fresh basil leaves, adding a burst of herbal fragrance to
        the already enticing aroma. Drizzle a hint of high-quality extra-virgin olive oil over the top to enrich the
        flavors.</p>

    <p>Finally, slice your homemade Classic Margherita Pizza into wedges or squares, depending on your preference, and
        savor the harmonious combination of the tomatoes, creamy mozzarella, and aromatic basil. This delightful pizza
        captures the essence of Italy and makes for a delightful meal enjoyed with family and friends. Buon appetito!
