    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a delightful Italian dish that boasts layers of rich flavors and textures. To prepare this classic
        comfort food, you'll need the following ingredients: lasagna noodles, lean ground beef or Italian sausage,
        crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, diced onions, minced garlic, dried basil, oregano, salt, black
        pepper, ricotta cheese, shredded mozzarella cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, and fresh parsley.</p>

    <p>Begin by preheating your oven to the recommended temperature. In a large skillet, cook the ground beef or Italian
        sausage until browned, then drain the excess fat. Stir in the diced onions and minced garlic, sautéing until
        they become fragrant. Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste, and season the sauce with dried
        basil, oregano, salt, and black pepper. Allow the mixture to simmer on low heat for about 20-25 minutes,
        allowing the flavors to meld together.</p>

    <p>While the sauce simmers, cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until they are al dente.
        In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese with some chopped fresh parsley and a pinch of salt.</p>

    <p>Now it's time to assemble the lasagna. In a large baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the
        bottom. Arrange a layer of cooked lasagna noodles on top, followed by dollops of the ricotta cheese mixture and
        a generous sprinkle of shredded mozzarella and grated Parmesan. Repeat the layers, finishing with a final layer
        of noodles on top. Spread any remaining meat sauce and cheeses over the last layer of noodles.</p>

    <p>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes. Then, remove the
        foil and continue baking for an additional 10-15 minutes or until the cheese on top turns golden and bubbly.</p>

    <p>Once it's done, take the lasagna out of the oven and let it rest for a few minutes before cutting and serving.
        The result is a mouthwatering masterpiece of savory flavors, creamy cheese, and tender noodles, sure to delight
        family and friends with every delicious bite. Enjoy!</p>
